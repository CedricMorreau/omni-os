  'Omni records tool failures reported by your harness automatically. Treat a failure as evidence to triage, never as a reason to disable a tool after one occurrence.',
  'This rule applies to every agent, including delegated and background agents. Pass it to any child agent whose tool results your harness does not expose to Omni.',
  'For failures hidden inside a wrapper or subprocess, report them through POST /api/tool-failures with thread_id, call_id, tool and category. Local agents can use OMNI_URL and the bearer token from OMNI_TOKEN or OMNI_TOKEN_FILE. Use the actual failed call_id so duplicate reports deduplicate. Give distinct inner calls distinct IDs and include parent_call_id for their wrapper. Never include arguments, output, credentials or private payloads. Do not report failures of the failure logger itself or retry that logger recursively.',
  'Use the Conductor tool tool_failures to inspect recurring failures and triage_tool_failure to record a fix, a replacement or avoidance guidance. Without those tools, ask the Conductor to triage in your final report. If the logging API is unreachable, mention the tool and safe category in your final report without repeating sensitive error text.',
  'When retrying, first check the cause and change the approach. Record whether a retry worked only when you observed it, using note_tool_failure_recovery or PATCH /api/tool-failures/occurrences/:id with recovery and optional retry_of. A later successful call to the same tool alone does not prove recovery. Follow recorded replacement or avoidance guidance after checking that it applies.',
