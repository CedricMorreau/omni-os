# Omni OS for iOS

This development client contains a home screen and a connect screen stub. It does not connect to a server or save a server address yet. Expo Go is not supported.

## Run on the iOS simulator

Install Xcode, an iOS simulator runtime, Node 24.3 or later in the 24.x line or Node 26 or later, npm 11.19.0, and CocoaPods. From the repository root:

```sh
npm ci --include=dev
npm run ios --workspace @omni/ios
```

Expo generates the native project and opens a development build in the simulator. For later sessions, start Metro with:

```sh
npm run dev --workspace @omni/ios
```

Open the installed Omni OS development client and select the Metro server. If the simulator cannot reach Metro, run Metro on the Mac and use its loopback address.

## Connect to a server

The Connect screen is a placeholder. Server selection, pairing, and HTTP and SSE access are not implemented in this milestone. Do not enter credentials into the placeholder.

## EAS builds

Run EAS commands from `apps/ios` after installing the EAS CLI and signing in to an Expo account. Configure the EAS project and Apple signing before building for a device or TestFlight. The profiles in `eas.json` are:

- `development` builds an internal development client.
- `development-simulator` builds the development client for the simulator.
- `preview` builds an internal distribution build.
- `production` builds a production release and increments its build number.

For example, run `eas build --platform ios --profile development-simulator` to build for the simulator. Physical devices and TestFlight require Apple Developer signing and an Expo account.

## Reference setup

The Expo, React Native, React Navigation, Effect, Uniwind, development client, and EAS setup follows T3 Code's mobile app at `c65f8d552baca1b51e15b5fb4737f07e18cce177`. Omni uses npm workspaces rather than T3's pnpm catalog. The navigation screens package uses the public 4.x release rather than T3's private 5.x fork. T3's unrelated native modules, authentication, widgets, and product-specific Expo configuration are not included in this placeholder app.
