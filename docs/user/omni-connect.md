# Omni Connect

Omni Connect opens your Omni from a phone or another computer without Tailscale. Your sync relay creates a Cloudflare tunnel for each machine that turns it on, at a hostname like `https://bens-macbook-a1b2c3.omni-os.app`. A Connect page on the relay lists those machines. Sign in there with Google once, and Open signs that browser in to any of them. Why it works this way: [ADR 0009](../adr/0009-omni-connect.md).

It is optional, and it needs the [sync relay](sync.md) sign-in first. It uses the same relay and the same Google account.

## Set it up

1. Give the relay its Cloudflare secrets. `npm run relay:config` prints them: `CF_API_TOKEN` (an API token with Account: Cloudflare Tunnel: Edit, and Zone: DNS: Edit on the zone), `CF_ACCOUNT_ID`, `CF_ZONE_ID` and `CONNECT_ZONE` (`omni-os.app`). Set them with `npx wrangler secret put` or `npx wrangler secret bulk` from `apps/relay`. Without them the relay answers 503 `connect_not_configured` to Connect calls, and sync keeps working.
2. Install `cloudflared` on each machine: `brew install cloudflared`. Omni looks on `PATH` and in Homebrew's folders. Set `OMNI_CLOUDFLARED` to its path if it is somewhere else. Omni never downloads it.
3. On each machine, turn it on in Settings, Omni Connect. The Conductor can do the same with `omni_connect_set`, and `omni_connect_status` shows the hostname, the tunnel state and the machines.

Turning Connect on links the relay's Google account as this Omni's owner if none is linked yet. A machine linked to a different Google account refuses to turn Connect on.

## Open a machine from a phone

- Bookmark `<relay URL>/connect` (Settings, Omni Connect shows it). Sign in with Google there once. The relay keeps you signed in for 30 days. Tap Open next to a machine.
- Or open the machine's own `https://<name>-xxxxxx.omni-os.app` address and choose Open with Omni Connect on the pairing screen.

Either way the machine signs that browser in. The browser gets an ordinary signed-in device session, listed in Settings, Machines with the other signed-in devices. Revoke it there like any other. Opening again later makes a new session.

## What to know

- The machine must be awake with Omni running. The Connect page shows a machine as offline when it does not answer within 5 seconds.
- The Connect hostname needs the token or a session on every route, as a `.ts.net` name does. The Tailscale login check (`integrations.tailscaleLogin`) does not apply there, because that request did not come through Tailscale.
- Turning Connect off deletes the machine's tunnel and DNS record on Cloudflare. Sessions it already made stay until you revoke them.
- Signing out of sync (Sign Out in Settings, Machines) also deletes the machine's tunnel on the relay.
